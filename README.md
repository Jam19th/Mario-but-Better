# Mario-but-Better

Game instructions:
1. Zoom the game window until you see green blocks surrounding the perimeter of the screen. (67% zoom should work for most players on a 1920*1080 resolution)

2. Controls are the left and right arrow keys to move and the space bar to jump.

3. The goal of the game is to avoid the green blocks and make it to the stones at the end of the screen, but beware the blue block are nor necessarily your friends.

4. If you collide with a green block or win the game press Enter to restart the game.
